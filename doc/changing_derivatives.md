# Managing Derivatives

This guide shows how to add, create, update, and remove [derivatives] for an 
app in production already handling file attachments, with zero downtime.

*Note: The examples uses the [Sequel] ORM, but it should easily translate to 
Active Record.*

Let's assume we have a `Photo` model with an `image` file attachment. The 
examples will be showing image thumbnails, but the advice applies to any kind 
of derivatives. 

```rb
Shrine.plugin :sequel
```
```rb
class ImageUploader < Shrine
  # ...
end
```
```rb
class Photo < Sequel::Model
  include ImageUploader::Attachment(:image)
end
```

## Adding derivatives

*Scenario: Your app is currently working only with original files, and you want
to introduce derivatives.*

Start by loading the `derivatives` plugin in the uploader and load any processing
libraries or gems needed for your scenario. In our example, the 
`image_processing` gem is required to process images and therefore is
loaded in the Gemfile. 

Next, we define the processing logic. In this example, we are creating a 
`thumbnails` derivatives processor which will be responsible to create 
`small`, `medium`, and `large` thumbnails of the original `image`.

```rb
# Gemfile
gem "image_processing", "~> 1.2"
```
```rb
require "image_processing/mini_magick"

class ImageUploader < Shrine
  plugin :derivatives

  Attacher.derivatives_processor :thumbnails do |original|
    processor = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)

    # generate the thumbnails you want here
    {
      small:  processor.resize_to_limit!(300, 300),
      medium: processor.resize_to_limit!(500, 500),
      large:  processor.resize_to_limit!(800, 800),
    }
  end
end
```

*Note: we cannot update our attachment URLs to use derivatives yet, because 
only new attachments will have thumbnails generated, existing attachments will 
only have the original file.*

Now deploy this change to production.

Next we will run the following script to generate derivatives for all existing 
attachments in production. It fetches the photos in batches, downloads the image 
into the permanent storage, creates derivatives, and persist the changes. 

```rb
Photo.paged_each do |photo|
  attacher = photo.image_attacher

  next unless attacher.stored?      # reprocess only attachments uploaded to permanent storage

  attacher.create_derivatives(:thumbnails)

  begin
    attacher.atomic_persist         # persist changes if attachment has not changed in the meantime
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged, # attachment has changed
         Sequel::NoExistingObject   # record has been deleted
    attacher.delete_derivatives     # delete now orphaned derivatives
  end
end
```

Now all attachments should have correctly generated derivatives. You can update
the attachment URLs to use derivatives as needed.

## Reprocessing all derivatives

*Scenario: The processing logic has changed for all derivatives, and now you
want to reprocess them for existing attachments.*

Deploy the processing logic change to production and then run the following
script to reprocess all derivatives. It fetches the photos in batches, 
downloads the image into the permanent storage, reprocesses new derivatives, persist 
the changes, and deletes old derivatives. 

```rb
Photo.paged_each do |photo|
  attacher = photo.image_attacher

  next unless attacher.stored?

  old_derivatives = attacher.derivatives

  attacher.set_derivatives({})                    # clear derivatives
  attacher.create_derivatives(:thumbnails)        # reprocess derivatives

  begin
    attacher.atomic_persist                       # persist changes if attachment has not changed in the meantime
    attacher.delete_derivatives(old_derivatives)  # delete old derivatives
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged,               # attachment has changed
         Sequel::NoExistingObject                 # record has been deleted
    attacher.delete_derivatives                   # delete now orphaned derivatives
  end
end
```

## Reprocessing certain derivatives

*Scenario: The processing logic has changed for specific derivatives, and now
you want to reprocess them for existing attachments.*

Let's assume we want to change the size of the `medium` thumbnail and have 
deployed the following change: 

```diff
Attacher.derivatives_processor :thumbnails do |original|
  processor = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)

  {
    small:  processor.resize_to_limit!(300, 300),
-   medium: processor.resize_to_limit!(500, 500),
+   medium: processor.resize_to_limit!(600, 600),
    large:  processor.resize_to_limit!(800, 800),
  }
end
```

Run the following script to reprocess the derivative for all existing photos. 
It fetches the photos in batches, downloads the image into the permanent storage, 
reprocesses the specific derivative, persist the change, and deletes old derivative.

```rb
Photo.paged_each do |photo|
  attacher = photo.image_attacher

  next unless attacher.derivatives.key?(:medium)

  old_medium = attacher.derivatives[:medium]
  new_medium = attacher.file.download do |original|
    ImageProcessing::MiniMagick
      .source(original)
      .resize_to_limit!(600, 600)
  end

  attacher.add_derivative(:medium, new_medium)

  begin
    attacher.atomic_persist               # persist changes if attachment has not changed in the meantime
    old_medium.delete
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged,       # attachment has changed
         Sequel::NoExistingObject         # record has been deleted
    attacher.derivatives[:medium].delete  # delete now orphaned derivative
  end
end
```

## Adding more derivatives

*Scenario: A new derivative has been added to the processor, and now
you want to add it to existing attachments.*

Let's assume we added a new derivative `x_large` to `thumbnails` processor 
and have deployed the following change: 

```diff
Attacher.derivatives_processor :thumbnails do |original|
  processor = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)

  {
    small:   processor.resize_to_limit!(300,  300),
    medium:  processor.resize_to_limit!(600,  600),
    large:   processor.resize_to_limit!(800,  800),
+   x_large: processor.resize_to_limit!(1200, 1200),
  }
end
```

Run the following script to add the new derivative for all existing photos. 
It fetches the photos in batches, downloads the image into permanent storage, 
creates the new derivative, and persists the changes.

```rb
Photo.paged_each do |photo|
  attacher = photo.image_attacher

  next unless attacher.stored?

  x_large = attacher.file.download do |original|
    ImageProcessor::MiniMagick
      .source(original)
      .resize_to_limit!(1200, 1200)
  end

  attacher.add_derivative(:x_large, x_large)

  begin
    attacher.atomic_persist                 # persist changes if attachment has not changed in the meantime
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged,         # attachment has changed
         Sequel::NoExistingObject           # record has been deleted
    attacher.derivatives[:x_large].delete   # delete now orphaned derivative
  end
end
```

Now all attachments should have the new derivative and you can start generating
URLs for it.

## Removing derivatives

*Scenario: A derivative isn't being used anymore, so we want to delete it for
existing attachments.*

Let's assume we removed the `x_large` derivative in the `thumbnails` processor 
and have deployed the following change:

```diff
Attacher.derivatives_processor :thumbnails do |original|
  processor = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)

  {
    small:   processor.resize_to_limit!(300,  300),
    medium:  processor.resize_to_limit!(600,  600),
    large:   processor.resize_to_limit!(800,  800),
-   x_large: processor.resize_to_limit!(1200, 1200),
  }
end
```

Run the following script to remove the unused derivative for all existing photos. 
It fetches the photos in batches, deletes the `x_large` derivative, and persists 
the changes.

```rb
Photo.paged_each do |photo|
  attacher = photo.image_attacher

  next unless attacher.derivatives.key?(:x_large)

  x_large = attacher.remove_derivative(:x_large)

  begin
    attacher.atomic_persist           # persist changes if attachment has not changed in the meantime
    x_large.delete
  rescue Shrine::AttachmentChanged,   # attachment has changed
         Sequel::NoExistingObject     # record has been deleted
  end
end
```
