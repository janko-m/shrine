# Advantages of Shrine

There are many existing file upload solutions for Ruby out there – [Paperclip],
[CarrierWave], [Dragonfly], [Refile], and [Active Storage], to name the most
popular ones. This guide will attempt to cover some of the main advantages that
Shrine offers compared to these alternatives.

## Generality

Many alternative file upload solutions are coupled to either Rails (Active
Storage) or Active Record itself (Paperclip, Dragonfly). This is not ideal, as
Rails-specific solutions fragment the Ruby community between developers that
use Rails and developers that don't. There are many great web frameworks
([Sinatra], [Roda], [Cuba], [Hanami], [Grape]) and database libraries
([Sequel], [ROM], [Hanami::Model]) out there that people use instead of
Rails and Active Record.

Shrine, on the other hand, doesn't make any assumptions about which web
framework or ORM you're using. Any web-specific functionality is implemented
on top of [Rack], the Ruby web server interface that powers all the popular
Ruby web frameworks (including Rails). The integrations for specific ORMs are
provided as plugins.

```rb
# Rack-based plugins
Shrine.plugin :upload_endpoint
Shrine.plugin :presign_endpoint
Shrine.plugin :download_endpoint
Shrine.plugin :derivation_endpoint
Shrine.plugin :rack_response
Shrine.plugin :rack_file

# ORM plugins
Shrine.plugin :activerecord
Shrine.plugin :sequel
Shrine.plugin :mongoid # https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine-mongoid
Shrine.plugin :hanami # https://github.com/katafrakt/hanami-shrine
```

## Simplicity

Where some popular file attachment libraries have [god objects]
(`CarrierWave::Uploader::Base` and `Paperclip::Attachment`), Shrine has several
core classes, each with a clear set of responsibilities:

* Storage classes encapsulate file operations for the underlying service
* `Shrine` handles uploads and manages plugins
* `Shrine::UploadedFile` repesents a file that was uploaded to a storage
* `Shrine::Attacher` handles attaching files to records
* `Shrine::Attachment` adds convenience methods to model instances

```rb
photo.image          #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
photo.image.storage  #=> #<Shrine::Storage::S3>
photo.image.uploader #=> #<Shrine>
photo.image_attacher #=> #<Shrine::Attacher>
```

The attachment functionality is decoupled from persistence and storage, which
makes it much easier to reason about. Also, special care was taken to make
integrating new storages and ORMs possible with minimal amount of code.

## Modularity

Shrine uses a [plugin system] that allows you to pick and choose the features
that you want. Moreover, you'll only be loading code for the features you've
selected, which means that Shrine will generally much faster than the
alternatives.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :instrumentation

# translates to

require "shrine/plugins/instrumentation"
Shrine.plugin Shrine::Plugins::Instrumentation
```

Shrine recommends a certain type of attachment flow, but it still offers good
low-level abstractions that give you the flexibility to build your own
attachment flow.

```rb
uploaded_file = ImageUploader.upload(image, :store) # metadata extraction, upload location generation
uploaded_file.id       #=> "44ccafc10ce6a4ff22829e8f579ee6b9.jpg"
uplaoded_file.metadata #=> { ... extracted metadata ... }

data = uploaded_file.to_json # serialization
# ...
uploaded_file = ImageUploader.uploaded_file(data) # deserialization

uploaded_file.url #=> "https://..."
uploaded_file.download { |tempfile| ... } # streaming download
uploaded_file.delete
```

### Dependencies

Shrine is very diligent when it comes to dependencies. It has two mandatory
dependencies – [Down] and [ContentDisposition] – which are loaded only by
components that need them. Some Shrine plugins also require additional
dependencies, but you only need to load them if you're using those plugins.

Moreover, Shrine often gives you the ability choose between multiple
alternative dependencies for doing the same task. For example, the
`determine_mime_type` plugin allows you to choose between the [`file`] command,
[FileMagic], [FastImage], [MimeMagic], or [Marcel] gem for determining the MIME
type, while the `store_dimensions` plugin can extract dimensions using
[FastImage], [MiniMagick], or [ruby-vips] gem.

```rb
Shrine.plugin :determine_mime_type, analyzer: :marcel
Shrine.plugin :store_dimensions,    analyzer: :mini_magick
```

This approach gives you control over your dependencies by allowing you to
choose the combination that best suits your needs.

## Inheritance

Shrine is designed to handle any types of files. If you're accepting uploads of
multiple types of files, such as videos and images, chances are that the logic
for handling them will differ:

* small images can be processed on-the-fly, but large files should be processed in a background job
* you might want to store different files to different storage services (images, documents, audios, videos)
* extracting metadata might require different tools depending on the filetype

With Shrine you can create isolated uploaders for each type of file. Plugins
that you want to be applied to all uploaders can be applied globally, while
other plugins would be loaded only for a specific uploader.

```rb
# loaded for all plugins
Shrine.plugin :activerecord
Shrine.plugin :instrumentation
```
```rb
class ImageUploader < Shrine
  # loaded only for ImageUploader
  plugin :store_dimensions
end
```
```rb
class VideoUploader < Shrine
  # loaded only for VideoUploader
  plugin :default_storage, store: :vimeo
end
```

## Processing

Most file attachment libraries give you the ability to process files either "on
attachment" (Paperclip, CarrierWave) or "on-the-fly" (Dragonfly, Refile, Active
Storage). However, you should ideally be able to choose both, because both
approaches have their pros and cons. For example, on-the-fly processing is only
suitable for fast processing (image thumbnails, document previews), longer
running processing should be moved into a background job (video transcoding,
raw images).

Shrine is the first file attachment library that has support for both
processing on attachment and on-the-fly. So, if you're handling image uploads,
you can choose to either generate a set of pre-defined image thumbnails in a
background job:

```rb
class ImageUploader < Shrine
  Attacher.derivatives_processor do |original|
    magick = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick.source(original)

    {
      large:  magick.resize_to_limit!(800, 800),
      medium: magick.resize_to_limit!(500, 500),
      small:  magick.resize_to_limit!(300, 300),
    }
  end
end
```
```rb
photo.image_url(:large)
#=> "https://s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/large.jpg"
```

or generate thumbnails on-demand:

```rb
class ImageUploader < Shrine
  derivation :thumbnail do |file, width, height|
    ImageProcessing::MiniMagick
      .source(file)
      .resize_to_limit!(width.to_i, height.to_i)
  end
end
```
```rb
photo.image.derivation_url(:thumbnail, 600, 400)
#=> ".../thumbnail/600/400/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN0b3JhZ2UiOiJzdG9yZSJ9?signature=..."
```

### Image processing

Many file attachment libraries, such as CarrierWave, Paperclip, Dragonfly and
Refile, implement their own image processing macros. Instead of creating
yet another in-house implementation, the **[ImageProcessing]** gem was created.

While the ImageProcessing gem was created for Shrine, it's completely generic
and can be used standalone or with any other file upload library (e.g. Active
Storage 6+ uses it). It takes care of many details for you, such as [auto
orienting] the input image and [sharpening] the thumbnails after they are
resized.

```rb
require "image_processing"

thumbnail = ImageProcessing::MiniMagick
  .source(image)
  .resize_to_limit(400, 400)
  .call # convert input.jpg -auto-orient -resize 400x400> -sharpen 0x1 output.jpg

thumbnail #=> #<Tempfile:/var/folders/.../image_processing20180316-18446-1j247h6.png>
```

#### libvips

Probably the biggest ImageProcessing feature is the support for **[libvips]**.
libvips is a full-featured image processing library like ImageMagick, with
impressive performance characteristics – it's often **multiple times faster**
than ImageMagick and has low memory usage (see [Why is libvips quick]).

The `ImageProcessing::Vips` backend implements the same API as
`ImageProcessing::MiniMagick`, so you can easily swap one for the other.

```rb
require "image_processing/vips"

ImageProcessing::Vips
  .source(image)
  .resize_to_limit!(400, 400)
```

### Other processors

Both processing "on upload" and "on-the-fly" work in a way that you define a
Ruby block, which accepts a source file and is expected to return a processed
file. How you're going to do the processing is entirely up to you.

This allows you to use any tool you want. For example, you could implement
video transcoding:

```rb
class VideoUploader < Shrine
  Attacher.derivatives_processor do |original|
    transcoded = Tempfile.new ["transcoded", ".mp4"]
    screenshot = Tempfile.new ["screenshot", ".jpg"]

    movie = FFMPEG::Movie.new(original.path)
    movie.transcode(transcoded.path)
    movie.screenshot(screenshot.path)

    { transcoded: transcoded, screenshot: screenshot }
  end
end
```

## Metadata & Validation

Shrine automatically [extracts metadata][metadata] from each uploaded file,
including derivatives like image thumbnails, and saves them into the database
column. In addition to filename, filesize, and MIME type that are extracted by
default, you can also extract [image dimensions][store_dimensions], or your own
[custom metadata][add_metadata].

```rb
photo.image.metadata #=>
# {
#   "size" => 42487494,
#   "filename" => "nature.jpg",
#   "mime_type" => "image/jpeg",
#   "width" => 600,
#   "height" => 400,
#   ...
# }
```

For common metadata you can use the built-in [validators][validation_helpers],
but you can also [validate any custom metadata][custom validations].

```rb
class DocumentUploader < Shrine
  Attacher.validate do
    # validation macros
    validate_max_size 10*1024*1024
    validate_mime_type %W[application/pdf]

    # custom validations
    if file["page_count"] > 30
      errors << "must not have more than 30 pages"
    end
  end
end
```

## Backgrounding

In most file upload solutions background processing was an afterthought, which
resulted in complex implementations. Shrine was designed with backgrounding
feature in mind from day one. It is supported via the
[`backgrounding`][backgrounding] plugin and can be used with [any backgrounding
library][backgrounding libraries].

```rb
Shrine::Attacher.promote_block do
  PromoteJob.perform_async(self.class.name, record.class.name, record.id, name, file_data)
end
```
```rb
class PromoteJob
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(attacher_class, record_class, record_id, name, file_data)
    attacher_class = Object.const_get(attacher_class)
    record         = Object.const_get(record_class).find(record_id) # if using Active Record

    attacher = attacher_class.retrieve(model: record, name: name, file: file_data)
    attacher.create_derivatives # perform processing
    attacher.atomic_promote
  end
end
```

## Direct Uploads

Shrine doesn't come with a plug-and-play JavaScript solution for client-side
uploads like Refile and Active Storage, but instead it adopts **[Uppy]**. Uppy
is a modern JavaScript file upload library, which offers support for uploading
to [AWS S3][Uppy AwsS3], to a [custom endpoint][Uppy XHRUpload], or even to a
[resumable endpoint][Uppy Tus]. It comes with a set of UI components, ranging
from a simple [status bar][Uppy StatusBar] to a full-featured [dashboard][Uppy
Dashboard]. Since Uppy is maintained by the wide JavaScript community, it's
generally a better choice than any homegrown solution.

Shrine provides Rack components for uploads that integrate nicely with Uppy.
So, whether you want Uppy to upload directly [to your app][upload_endpoint], or
you want to authorize direct uploads [to the cloud][presign_endpoint], Shrine
has it streamlined.

### Resumable uploads

If your users are uploading large files, flaky internet connections can cause
uploads to fail halfway, which can be a frustrating user experience. To fix
this problem, [Transloadit] company has created an open HTTP-based protocol for
resumable uploads – **[tus]**. There are already countless client and server
[implementations][tus implementations] of the protocol in various languages.

So, if you're expecting large file uploads, you can use Uppy as a [JavaScript
client][Uppy Tus] and have it upload to [Ruby server][tus-ruby-server], then
attach uploaded files using the handy [Shrine integration][shrine-tus]. Shrine
handles uploads and downloads in a streaming fashion, so you can expect low
memory usage.

Alternatively, you can have [resumable multipart uploads directly to
S3][uppy-s3_multipart].

## Summary

Shrine is general purpose, it can integrate with any web framework and any
database library. It has core classes with clearly defined responsibilities,
which provide both higher and lower level abstractions. The functionality is
very modular, you can pick and choose features that you need.

With Shrine you can process both on attachment and on-the-fly, depending on
what is more suitable for your requirements. Processing is just a functional
transformation, which makes it easier to use the processing tool of your
choice. You can also move processing into a background job.

Shrine automatically extracts metadata from the main file and any processed
files. In addition to built-in metadata you can also extract any custom
metadata. Any extracted metadata can be validated on attachment.

Finally, Shrine integrates with Uppy, a full-featured JavaScript file upload
library. It allows you to do direct uploads to your app or to S3. For large
files you can also make the uploads resumable.
