    # The direct_upload plugin provides a Rack endpoint (implemented in [Roda])
    # which you can use to implement AJAX uploads.
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, max_size: 20*1024*1024
    #
    # This is how you could mount the endpoint in a Rails application:
    #
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       # adds `POST /attachments/images/:storage/:name`
    #       mount ImageUploader.direct_endpoint => "/attachments/images"
    #     end
    #
    # Note that you should mount a separate endpoint for each uploader that you
    # want to use it with. This now gives your Ruby application a
    # `POST /attachments/images/:storage/:name` route, which accepts a "file"
    # query parameter:
    #
    #     $ curl -F "file=@/path/to/avatar.jpg" localhost:3000/attachments/images/cache/avatar
    #     # {"id":"43kewit94.jpg","storage":"cache","metadata":{...}}
    #
    # The endpoint returns all responses in JSON format. There are many great
    # JavaScript libraries for AJAX file uploads, so for example if we have
    # this form:
    #
    #     <%= form_for @user do |f| %>
    #       <%= f.hidden_field :avatar, value: @user.avatar_data %>
    #       <%= f.file_field :avatar %>
    #     <% end %>
    #
    # this is how we could hook up [jQuery-File-Upload] to our direct upload
    # endpoint:
    #
    #     $('[type="file"]').fileupload({
    #       url: '/attachments/images/cache/avatar',
    #       paramName: 'file',
    #       done: function(e, data) { $(this).prev().value(data.result) }
    #     });
    #
    # Now whenever a file gets chosen, the upload will automatically start in
    # the background. It's typically good to show a progress bar to the user,
    # which jQuery-File-Upload [supports]. After the upload has finished, the
    # uploaded file JSON is written to the hidden field, and will be sent on
    # form submit.
    #
    # ## Presigned
    #
    # An alternative to the direct endpoint is doing direct uploads to the
    # underlying storage. These uploads usually requires extra information
    # from the server, and this plugin can provide an endpoint to it, which
    # you can enable by passing in `presign: true`:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, presign: true
    #
    # This will disable the default `POST /:storage/:name` route (for security
    # reasons), and enable `GET /:storage/presign`. The response for that
    # request looks something like this:
    #
    #     {
    #       "url" => "https://shrine-testing.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",
    #       "fields" => {
    #         "key" => "b7d575850ba61b44c8a9ff889dfdb14d88cdc25f8dd121004c8",
    #         "policy" => "eyJleHBpcmF0aW9uIjoiMjAxNS0QwMToxMToyOVoiLCJjb25kaXRpb25zIjpbeyJidWNrZXQiOiJzaHJpbmUtdGVzdGluZyJ9LHsia2V5IjoiYjdkNTc1ODUwYmE2MWI0NGU3Y2M4YTliZmY4OGU5ZGZkYjE2NTQ0ZDk4OGNkYzI1ZjhkZDEyMTAwNGM4In0seyJ4LWFtei1jcmVkZW50aWFsIjoiQUtJQUlKRjU1VE1aWlk0NVVUNlEvMjAxNTEwMjQvZXUtd2VzdC0xL3MzL2F3czRfcmVxdWVzdCJ9LHsieC1hbXotYWxnb3JpdGhtIjoiQVdTNC1ITUFDLVNIQTI1NiJ9LHsieC1hbXotZGF0ZSI6IjIwMTUxMDI0VDAwMTEyOVoifV19",

    #         "x-amz-algorithm" => "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256",
    #         "x-amz-date" => "20151024T001129Z",
    #         "x-amz-signature" => "c1eb634f83f96b69bd675f535b3ff15ae184b102fcba51e4db5f4959b4ae26f4"
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # The `url` is where the file needs to be uploaded to, and `fields` is
    # additional data that needs to be send on the upload. The `fields.key`
    # attribute is the location where the file will be uploaded to, it is
    # generated randomly. `GET /:storage/presign` accepts additional parameters:
    #
    # :extension
    # : The extension of the file being uploaded (e.g ".jpg").
    #
    # :content_type
    # : Sets the Content-Type header for the uploaded file on S3.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #     GET /cache/presign?content_type=image/jpeg
    #     GET /cache/presign?extension=.png
    #
    # ## Constraints
    #
    # Note that the direct upload doesn't run validations, they are only run
    # when attached to the record. If you want to limit the MIME type of files,
    # you could add an ["accept" attribute] to your file field. You could also
    # add client side validations for the maximum file size.
    #
    # It's encouraged that you set the `:max_size` option for the endpoint.
    # Once set, when a file that is too big is uploaded, the endpoint will
    # automatically delete the file and return a 413 response.  However, if for
    # whatever reason you don't want to impose a limit on filesize, you can set
    # the option to nil:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, max_size: nil
    #
    # ## Allowed storages
    #
    # While Shrine only accepts cached attachments on form submits (for security
    # reasons), you can use this endpoint to upload files to any storage, just
    # add it do allowed storages:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, allowed_storages: [:cache, :store]
    #
    # ## Authentication
    #
    # If you want to authenticate the endpoint, you should be able to do it
    # easily if your web framework has a good enough router. For example, in
    # Rails you could add a `constraints` directive:
    #
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       constraints(->(r){r.env["warden"].authenticate!}) do
    #         mount ImageUploader.direct_endpoint => "/attachments/images"
    #       end
    #     end
