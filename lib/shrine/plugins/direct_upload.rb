  module Plugins
    # The direct_upload plugin provides a [Roda] endpoint which can be used for
    # uploading individual files asynchronously.
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload
    #
    # This is how you could mount the endpoint in a Rails application:
    #
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount ImageUploader::UploadEndpoint => "/attachments/images"
    #     end
    #
    # You should always mount a new endpoint for each uploader that you want to
    # enable direct uploads for. This now gives your Ruby application a `POST
    # /attachments/images/:storage/:name` route, which accepts a "file" query
    # parameter, and returns the uploaded file in JSON format:
    #
    #     # POST /attachments/images/cache/avatar (file upload)
    #     {
    #       "id": "43kewit94.jpg",
    #       "storage": "cache",
    #       "metadata": {
    #         "size": 384393,
    #         "filename": "nature.jpg",
    #         "mime_type": "image/jpeg"
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # Once you've uploaded the file, you need to assign the result to the
    # hidden attachment field in the form. There are many great JavaScript
    # libraries for file uploads, most popular being [jQuery-File-Upload].
    #
    # ## Limiting filesize
    #
    # It's good idea to limit the maximum filesize of uploaded files, if you
    # set the `:max_size` option, files which are too big will get
    # automatically deleted and 413 status will be returned:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, max_size: 5*1024*1024 # 5 MB
    #
    # Note that this option doesn't affect presigned uploads, but there you can
    # limit the filesize with storage options.
    #
    # ## Presigning
    #
    # An alternative to the direct endpoint is uploading directly to the
    # underlying storage (S3). These uploads usually require extra information
    # from the server, you can enable that route by passing `presign: true`:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, presign: true
    #
    # This will add `GET /:storage/presign`, and disable the default `POST
    # /:storage/:name` (for security reasons) The response for that request
    # looks something like this:
    #
    #     {
    #       "url" => "https://my-bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",
    #       "fields" => {
    #         "key" => "b7d575850ba61b44c8a9ff889dfdb14d88cdc25f8dd121004c8",
    #         "policy" => "eyJleHBpcmF0aW9uIjoiMjAxNS0QwMToxMToyOVoiLCJjb25kaXRpb25zIjpbeyJidWNrZXQiOiJzaHJpbmUtdGVzdGluZyJ9LHsia2V5IjoiYjdkNTc1ODUwYmE2MWI0NGU3Y2M4YTliZmY4OGU5ZGZkYjE2NTQ0ZDk4OGNkYzI1ZjhkZDEyMTAwNGM4In0seyJ4LWFtei1jcmVkZW50aWFsIjoiQUtJQUlKRjU1VE1aWlk0NVVUNlEvMjAxNTEwMjQvZXUtd2VzdC0xL3MzL2F3czRfcmVxdWVzdCJ9LHsieC1hbXotYWxnb3JpdGhtIjoiQVdTNC1ITUFDLVNIQTI1NiJ9LHsieC1hbXotZGF0ZSI6IjIwMTUxMDI0VDAwMTEyOVoifV19",

    #       }
    #     }
    #
    # The `url` is where the file needs to be uploaded to, and `fields` is
    # additional data that needs to be send on the upload. The `fields.key`
    # attribute is the location where the file will be uploaded to, it is
    # generated randomly without an extension, but you can add it:
    #
    #     GET /cache/presign?extension=.png
    #
    # If you want additional options to be passed to Storage::S3#presign, you
    # can pass a block to `:presign`, and it will yield Roda's request object:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, presign: ->(request) do
    #       {
    #         content_length_range: 0..(5*1024*1024), # limit the filesize to 5 MB
    #         content_type: request.params["content_type"], # use "content_type" query parameter
    #       }
    #     end
    #
    # See the [Direct Uploads to S3] guide for further instructions on how to
    # hook this up in a form.
    #
    # ## Allowed storages
    #
    # While Shrine only accepts cached attachments on form submits (for security
    # reasons), you can use this endpoint to upload files to any storage, just
    # add it to allowed storages:
    #
    #     plugin :direct_upload, allowed_storages: [:cache, :store]
    #
    # ## Authentication
    #
    # If you want to authenticate the endpoint, you should be able to do it
    # easily if your web framework has a good enough router. For example, in
    # Rails you could add a `constraints` directive:
    #
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       constraints(->(r){r.env["warden"].authenticate!}) do
    #         mount ImageUploader::UploadEndpoint => "/attachments/images"
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # ## Customizing endpoint
    #
    # Since the endpoint is a [Roda] app, it can be easily customized via
    # plugins:
    #
    #     class MyUploader
    #       class UploadEndpoint
    #         plugin :hooks
    #
    #         after do |response|
    #           # ...
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Upon subclassing uploader the upload endpoint is also subclassed. You can
    # also call the plugin again in an uploader subclass to change its
    # configuration.
