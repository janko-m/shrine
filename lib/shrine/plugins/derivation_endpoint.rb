    # The `derivation_endpoint` plugin provides a Rack app for dynamically
    # processing uploaded files on request. This allows you to create URLs to
    # files that might not have been generated yet, and have the endpoint
    # process them on-the-fly.
    #
    # ## Quick start
    #
    # We first load the plugin, providing a secret key and a path prefix to
    # where the endpoint will be mounted:
    #
    #     class ImageUploader < Shrine
    #       plugin :derivation_endpoint,
    #         secret_key: "<your-secret-key>",
    #         prefix:     "derivations/image"
    #     end
    #
    # We can then mount the derivation endpoint for our uploader into our app's
    # router on the path prefix we specified:
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb (Rails)
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount ImageUploader.derivation_endpoint => "derivations/image"
    #     end
    #
    # Next we can define a "derivation" block for the type of processing we
    # want to apply to an attached file. For example, we can generate image
    # thumbnails using the [ImageProcessing] gem:
    #
    #     require "image_processing/mini_magick"
    #
    #     class ImageUploader < Shrine
    #       # ...
    #       derivation :thumbnail do |file, width, height|
    #         ImageProcessing::MiniMagick
    #           .source(file)
    #           .resize_to_limit!(width.to_i, height.to_i)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Now we can generate "derivation" URLs from attached files, which on
    # request will call the derivation block we defined.
    #
    #     photo.image.derivation_url(:thumbnail, "600", "400")
    #     #=> "/derivations/image/thumbnail/600/400/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN0b3JhZ2UiOiJzdG9yZSJ9?signature=..."
    #
    # In this example, `photo` is an instance of a `Photo` model which has an
    # `image` attachment. The URL will render a `600x400` thumbnail of the
    # original image.
    #
    # ## How it works
    #
    # The `#derivation_url` method is defined on `Shrine::UploadedFile`
    # objects. It generates an URL consisting of the configured path prefix,
    # derivation name and arguments, serialized uploaded file, and an URL
    # signature generated using the configured secret key:
    #
    #     /  derivations/image  /  thumbnail  /  600/400  /  eyJmZvbyIb3JhZ2UiOiJzdG9yZSJ9  ?  signature=...
    #       └──── prefix ─────┘  └── name ──┘  └─ args ─┘  └─── serialized source file ───┘
    #
    # When the derivation URL is requested, the derivation endpoint will first
    # verify the signature included in query params, and proceed only if it
    # matches the calculated signature. This ensures that only the server can
    # generate valid derivation URLs, preventing potential DoS attacks.
    #
    # The derivation endpoint then extracts the source file data, derivation
    # name and arguments from the request URL, and calls the corresponding
    # derivation block, passing the downloaded source file and derivation
    # arguments.
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |file, arg1, arg2, ...|
    #       file #=> #<Tempfile:...> (source file downloaded to disk)
    #       arg1 #=> "600" (first derivation argument in #derivation_url)
    #       arg2 #=> "400" (second derivation argument in #derivation_url)
    #
    #       # ... do processing ...
    #
    #       # return result as a File/Tempfile object or String/Pathname path
    #     end
    #
    # The derivation block is expected to return the processed file is a
    # `File`/`Tempfile` object or a `String`/`Pathname` path. The resulting
    # file is then rendered in the HTTP response.
    #
    # ### Performance
    #
    # By default, the processed file returned by the derivation block is not
    # cached anywhere. This means that repeated requests to the same derivation
    # URL will execute the derivation block each time, which can put a lot of
    # load on your application.
    #
    # For this reason it's highly recommended to put a **CDN or other HTTP
    # cache** in front of your application. If you've configured a CDN, you can
    # set the CDN host at the plugin level, and it will be used for all
    # derivation URLs:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, host: "https://your-dist-url.cloudfront.net"
    #
    # Additionally, you can have the endpoint cache derivatives to a storage.
    # With this setup, the generated derivative will be uploaded to the storage
    # on initial request, and then on subsequent requests the derivative will
    # be served directly from the storage.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true
    #
    # If you want to avoid having the endpoint directly serve the generated
    # derivatives, you can have the derivation response redirect to the
    # uploaded derivative on the storage service.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true, upload_redirect: true
    #
    # For more details, see the "Uploading" section.
    #
    # ## Derivation response
    #
    # Mounting the derivation endpoint into the app's router is the easiest way
    # to handle derivation requests, as routing and setting the response is
    # done automatically.
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount ImageUploader.derivation_endpoint => "derivations/image"
    #     end
    #
    # However, this approach can also be limiting if one wants to perform
    # additional operations around derivation requests, such as authentication
    # and authorization.
    #
    # Instead of mounting the endpoint into the router, you can also call the
    # derivation endpoint from a controller. In this case the endpoint needs to
    # receive the Rack env hash, so that it can infer derivation parameters
    # from the request URL. The return value is a 3-element array, containing
    # the status, headers, and body that should be returned in the HTTP
    # response:
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       get "/derivations/image/*rest" => "derivations#image"
    #     end
    #
    #     # app/controllers/derivations_controller.rb
    #     class DerivationsController < ApplicationController
    #       def image
    #         # we can perform authentication here
    #         set_rack_response ImageUploader.derivation_response(request.env)
    #       end
    #
    #       private
    #
    #       def set_rack_response((status, headers, body))
    #         self.status = status
    #         self.headers.merge!(headers)
    #         self.response_body = body
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # For even more control, you can generate derivation responses in custom
    # routes. Once you retrieve the `Shrine::UploadedFile` object, you can call
    # `#derivation_response` directly on it, passing the derivation name and
    # arguments, as well as the Rack env hash.
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       resources :photos do
    #         member do
    #           get "thumbnail" # for example
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #     # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb
    #     class PhotosController < ApplicationController
    #       def thumbnail
    #         # we can perform authorization here
    #         photo = Photo.find(params[:id])
    #         image = photo.image
    #
    #         set_rack_response image.derivation_response(:thumbnail, 300, 300, env: request.env)
    #       end
    #
    #       private
    #
    #       def set_rack_response((status, headers, body))
    #         self.status = status
    #         self.headers.merge!(headers)
    #         self.response_body = body
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # `Shrine.derivation_endpoint`, `Shrine.derivation_response`, and
    # `UploadedFile#derivation_response` methods all accept additional options,
    # which will override options set on the plugin level.
    #
    #     ImageUploader.derivation_endpoint(disposition: "attachment")
    #     # or
    #     ImageUploader.derivation_response(env, disposition: "attachment")
    #     # or
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_response(:thumbnail, env: env, disposition: "attachment")
    #
    # ## Dynamic settings
    #
    # For most options passed to `plugin :derivation_endpoint`,
    # `Shrine.derivation_endpoint`, `Shrine.derivation_response`, or
    # `Shrine::UploadedFile#derivation_response`, the value to be a block that
    # returns a dynamic result. The block will be evaluated within the context
    # of a `Shrine::Derivation` instance, allowing you to access information
    # about the current derivation:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, disposition: -> {
    #       self   #=> #<Shrine::Derivation>
    #
    #       name   #=> :thumbnail
    #       args   #=> ["500", "400"]
    #       source #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #
    #       # ...
    #     }
    #
    # For example, we can use it to specify that thumbnails should be rendered
    # inline in the browser, while other derivatives will be force downloaded.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, disposition: -> {
    #       name == :thumbnail ? "inline" : "attachment"
    #     }
    #
    # ## Host
    #
    # Derivation URLs are relative by default. To generate absolute URLs, you
    # can pass the `:host` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, host: "https://example.com"
    #
    # Now the generated URLs will include the specified URL host:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> "https://example.com/.../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # You can also pass `:host` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, host: "https://example.com")
    #     #=> "https://example.com/.../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # ## Prefix
    #
    # If you're mounting the derivation endpoint under a path prefix, the
    # derivation URLs will need to include that path prefix. This can be
    # configured with the `:prefix` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, prefix: "transformations/image"
    #
    # Now generated URLs will include the specified path prefix:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> ".../transformations/image/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # You can also pass `:prefix` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, prefix: "transformations/image")
    #     #=> ".../transformations/image/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # ## Expiration
    #
    # By default derivation URLs are valid indefinitely. If you want URLs to
    # expire after a certain amount of time, you can set the `:expires_in`
    # option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, expires_in: 90
    #
    # Now any URL will stop being valid 90 seconds after it was generated:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> ".../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?expires_at=1547843568&signature=..."
    #
    # You can also pass `:expires_in` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, expires_in: 90)
    #     #=> ".../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?expires_at=1547843568&signature=..."
    #
    # ## Response headers
    #
    # ### Content Type
    #
    # The derivation response includes the [`Content-Type`] header. By default
    # default its value will be inferred from the file extension of the
    # derivative (using `Rack::Mime`). This can be overriden with the `:type`
    # option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, type: -> {
    #       "image/webp" if name == :webp
    #     }
    #
    # The above will set `Content-Type` response header value to `image/webp`
    # for `:webp` derivatives, while for others it will be inferred from the
    # file extension.
    #
    # You can also set `:type` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:webp, type: "image/webp")
    #     #=> ".../webp/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?type=image%2Fwebp&signature=..."
    #
    # ### Content Disposition
    #
    # The derivation response includes the [`Content-Disposition`] header. By
    # default the disposition is set to `inline`, while the download filename
    # is generated from derivation name, arguments and source file id. These
    # values can be changed with the `:disposition` and `:filename` options:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint,
    #       disposition: -> { name == :thumbnail ? "inline" : "attachment" },
    #       filename:    -> { [name, *args].join("-") }
    #
    # With the above settings, visiting a thumbnail URL will render the image
    # in the browser, while other derivatives will be treated as an attachment
    # and be downloaded.
    #
    # The `:filename` and `:disposition` options can also be set per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:pdf, disposition: "attachment", filename: "custom-filename")
    #     #=> ".../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?disposition=attachment&filename=custom-filename&signature=..."
    #
    # ### Cache Control
    #
    # The endpoint uses the [`Cache-Control`] response header to tell clients
    # (browsers, CDNs, HTTP caches) how long they can cache derivation
    # responses. The default cache duration is 1 year since the initial
    # request. This can be changed with the `:cache_control` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, cache_control: { max_age: 7*24*60*60 } # 7 weeks
    #     # Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800
    #
    # It's also possible to modify any other `Cache-Control` directives:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, cache_control: { public: false, private: true }
    #     # Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000
    #
    # Note that `Cache-Control` is added to response headers only when using
    # `Shrine.derivation_endpoint` or `Shrine.derivation_response`, it's not
    # added when using `Shrine::UploadedFile#derivation_response`.
    #
    # ## Uploading
    #
    # By default the generated derivatives aren't saved anywhere, which means
    # that repeated requests to the same derivation URL will call the
    # derivation block each time. If you don't want to rely on solely on your
    # HTTP cache, you can enable the `:upload` option, which will make
    # derivatives automatically cached on the Shrine storage:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true
    #
    # Now whenever a derivation is requested, the endpoint will first check
    # whether the derivative already exists on the storage. If it doesn't
    # exist, it will fetch the original uploaded file, call the derivation
    # block, upload the derivative to the storage, and serve the derivative. If
    # the derivative does exist on checking, the endpoint will download the
    # derivative and serve it.
    #
    # The default upload location for derivatives is `<source id>/<name>-<args>`.
    # This can be changed with the `:upload_location` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true, upload_location: -> {
    #       # e.g. "derivatives/9a7d1bfdad24a76f9cfaff137fe1b5c7/thumbnail-1000-800"
    #       ["derivatives", File.basename(source.id, ".*"), [name, *args].join("-")].join("/")
    #     }
    #
    # Since the default upload location won't have any file extension, the
    # derivation response won't know the appropriate `Content-Type` header
    # value to set, and the generic `application/octet-stream` will be used.
    # It's recommended to use the `:type` option to set the appropriate
    # `Content-Type` value.
    #
    # The target storage used is the same as for the source uploaded file. The
    # `:upload_storage` option can be used to specify a different Shrine
    # storage:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_storage: :thumbnail_storage
    #
    # Additional storage-specific upload options can be passed via
    # `:upload_options`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_options: { acl: "public-read" }
    #
    # ### Redirecting
    #
    # You can configure the endpoint to redirect to the uploaded derivative on
    # the storage instead of serving it through the endpoint (which is the
    # default behaviour) by setting both `:upload` and `:upload_redirect` to
    # `true`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_redirect: true
    #
    # In that case additional storage-specific URL options can be passed in for
    # the redirect URL:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_redirect: true,
    #                                  upload_redirect_url_options: { public: true }
    #
    # ## Cache busting
    #
    # The derivation endpoint response instructs browsers, CDNs and other
    # clients to cache the response for a long time. This saves server
    # resources and improves response times. However, if the derivation block
    # is modified, the derivation URLs will remain unchanged, which means that
    # old cached derivatives might still be served.
    #
    # If you want to ensure derivation URLs don't point to old cached
    # derivatives, you can add a "version" query parameter to the URL, which
    # will make HTTP caches treat it as a new URL. You can do this via the
    # `:version` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, version: -> { 1 if name == :thumbnail }
    #
    # With the above settings, all `:thumbnail` derivation URLs will include
    # `version` in the query string:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> ".../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?version=1&signature=..."
    #
    # You can also bump the `:version` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, version: 1)
    #     #=> ".../thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?version=1&signature=..."
    #
    # ## Accessing source file
    #
    # If you want to access the source `UploadedFile` object when deriving, you
    # can set `:include_uploaded_file` to `true`.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, include_uploaded_file: true
    #
    # Now the source `UploadedFile` will be passed as the second argument of
    # the derivation block:
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |file, uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       uploaded_file             #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #       uploaded_file.id          #=> "9a7d1bfdad24a76f9cfaff137fe1b5c7.jpg"
    #       uploaded_file.storage_key #=> "store"
    #       uploaded_file.metadata    #=> {}
    #
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # By default original metadata that were extracted on attachment won't
    # be available in the derivation block. This is because metadata we want to
    # have available would need to be serialized into the derivation URL, which
    # would make it longer. However, you can opt in for the metadata you need
    # with the `:metadata` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, metadata: ["filename", "mime_type"]
    #
    # Now `filename` and `mime_type` metadata values will be available in the
    # derivation block:
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |file, uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       uploaded_file.metadata #=>
    #       # {
    #       #  "filename" => "nature.jpg",
    #       #  "mime_type" => "image/jpeg"
    #       # }
    #
    #       uploaded_file.original_filename #=> "nature.jpg"
    #       uploaded_file.mime_type         #=> "image/jpeg"
    #
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # ## Downloading
    #
    # When a derivation is requested, the original uploaded file will be
    # downloaded to disk before the derivation block is called. If you want
    # to pass in additional storage-specific download options, you can do so
    # via `:download_options`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, download_options: {
    #       sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
    #       sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
    #       sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5",
    #     }
    #
    # If the source file has been deleted, the error the storage raises when
    # attempting to download it will be propagated by default. For
    # `Shrine.derivation_endpoint` and `Shrine.derivation_response` you can
    # have these errors converted to 404 responses by adding them to
    # `:download_errors`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, download_errors: [
    #       Errno::ENOENT,              # raised by Shrine::Storage::FileSystem
    #       Aws::S3::Errors::NoSuchKey, # raised by Shrine::Storage::S3
    #     ]
    #
    # ### Skipping download
    #
    # If you for whatever reason you don't want the uploaded file to be
    # downloaded to disk for you, you can set `:download` to `false`.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, download: false
    #
    # In this case the `UploadedFile` object is yielded to the derivation block
    # instead of the raw file:
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       uploaded_file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # One use case for this is delegating processing to a 3rd-party service:
    #
    #     require "down/http"
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       # generate the thumbnail using ImageOptim.com
    #       Down::Http.download("https://im2.io/<USERNAME>/#{width}x#{height}/#{uploaded_file.url}")
    #     end
    #
    # ## Derivation API
    #
    # In addition to generating derivation responses, it's also possible to
    # operate with derivations on a lower level. You can access that API by
    # calling `UploadedFile#derivation`, which returns a `Derivation` object.
    #
    #     derivation = uploaded_file.derivation(:thumbnail, 500, 500)
    #     derivation #=> #<Shrine::Derivation: @name=:thumbnail, @args=[500, 500] ...>
    #     derivation.name   #=> :thumbnail
    #     derivation.args   #=> [500, 500]
    #     derivation.source #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #
    # When initializing the `Derivation` object you can override any plugin
    # options:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation(:grayscale, upload_storage: :other_storage)
    #
    # ### `#url`
    #
    # `Derivation#url` method (called by `UploadedFile#derivation_url`)
    # generates the URL to the derivation.
    #
    #     derivation.url #=> "/thumbnail/500/400/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN0b3JhZ2UiOiJzdG9yZSJ9?signature=..."
    #
    # ### `#response`
    #
    # `Derivation#response` method (called by `UploadedFile#derivation_response`)
    # generates appropriate status, headers, and body for the derivative to be
    # returned as an HTTP response.
    #
    #     status, headers, body = derivation.response
    #     status  #=> 200
    #     headers #=>
    #     # {
    #     #   "Content-Type" => "image/jpeg",
    #     #   "Content-Length" => "12424",
    #     #   "Content-Disposition" => "inline; filename=\"thumbnail-500-500-k9f8sdksdfk2414\"",
    #     #   "Accept_Ranges" => "bytes"
    #     # }
    #     body    #=> #each object that yields derivative content
    #
    # ### `#processed`
    #
    # `Derivation#processed` method returns the processed derivative. If
    # `:upload` is enabled, it returns an `UploadedFile` object pointing to the
    # derivative, processing and uploading the derivative if it hasn't been
    # already.
    #
    #     uploaded_file = derivation.processed
    #     uploaded_file    #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #     uploaded_file.id #=> "bcfd0d67e4a8ec2dc9a6d7ddcf3825a1/thumbnail-500-500"
    #
    # ### `#generate`
    #
    # `Derivation#generate` method calls the derivation block and returns the
    # result.
    #
    #     result = derivation.generate
    #     result #=> #<Tempfile:...>
    #
    # Internally it will download the source uploaded file to disk and pass it
    # to the derivation block (unless `:download` was disabled). You can
    # also pass in an already downloaded source file:
    #
    #     derivation.generate(source_file)
    #
    # ### `#upload`
    #
    # `Derivation#upload` method uploads the given file to the configured
    # derivation location.
    #
    #     uploaded_file = derivation.upload(file)
    #     uploaded_file    #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #     uploaded_file.id #=> "bcfd0d67e4a8ec2dc9a6d7ddcf3825a1/thumbnail-500-500"
    #
    # If not given any arguments, it generates the derivative before uploading
    # it.
    #
    # ### `#retrieve`
    #
    # `Derivation#retrieve` method returns the uploaded derivative file. If the
    # file exists on the storage, it returns an `UploadedFile` object,
    # otherwise `nil` is returned.
    #
    #     uploaded_file = derivation.retrieve
    #     uploaded_file    #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #     uploaded_file.id #=> "bcfd0d67e4a8ec2dc9a6d7ddcf3825a1/thumbnail-500-500"
    #
    # ### `#delete`
    #
    # `Derivation#delete` method deletes the uploaded derivative file from the
    # storage.
    #
    #     derivation.delete
    #
    # ### `#option`
    #
    # `Derivation#option` returns the value of the specified plugin option.
    #
    #     derivation.option(:upload_location)
    #     #=> "bcfd0d67e4a8ec2dc9a6d7ddcf3825a1/thumbnail-500-500"
