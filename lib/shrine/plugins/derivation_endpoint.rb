    # The `derivation_endpoint` plugin provides a Rack app for dynamically
    # processing uploaded files on request. This allows you to create URLs to
    # files that might not have been generated yet, and have the endpoint
    # process them on-the-fly.
    #
    # ## Quick start
    #
    # We first load the plugin, providing a secret key and a path prefix to
    # where the endpoint will be mounted:
    #
    #     class ImageUploader < Shrine
    #       plugin :derivation_endpoint,
    #         secret_key: "<your-secret-key>",
    #         prefix:     "derivations/image"
    #     end
    #
    # We can then mount the derivation endpoint for our uploader into our app's
    # router on the path prefix we specified:
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb (Rails)
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount ImageUploader.derivation_endpoint => "derivations/image"
    #     end
    #
    # Next we can define a derivation for type of processing we want to apply
    # to attached files. For example, we can generate image thumbnails using
    # the [ImageProcessing] gem:
    #
    #     require "image_processing/mini_magick"
    #
    #     class ImageUploader < Shrine
    #       derivation :thumbnail do |file, width, height|
    #         ImageProcessing::MiniMagick
    #           .source(file)
    #           .resize_to_limit!(width.to_i, height.to_i)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Now that we have our derivation defined and the endpoint mounted, we can
    # generate the an URL . If we have an instance
    # of a `Photo` model with an `image` attachment, we would call
    # `#derivation_url` on the attached file:
    #
    #     photo.image.derivation_url(:thumbnail, "400", "600")
    #     #=> "/derivations/image/thumbnail/400/600/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN0b3JhZ2UiOiJzdG9yZSJ9?signature=..."
    #
    # The example above assumes that `photo` is an instance of a `Photo` model
    # which defines an `image` attachment. Calling `photo.image` returns an
    # instance of `Shrine::UploadedFile` given that a file has been attached.
    #
    # ### Performance considerations
    #
    # Unless you've enabled `:upload` and `:upload_redirect` options, the
    # derivation endpoint will generate and serve derivatives on each request.
    # This can take a lot of resources, so you want it to happen rarely.
    #
    # Therefore, it's highly recommended to put a **CDN or other HTTP cache**
    # in front of your application. Once you have that, you can have derivation
    # URLs point to the CDN by setting the `:host` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, host: "https://your-dist-url.cloudfront.net"
    #
    # You can also set `:upload`, which will make the derivation endpoint cache
    # processed derivatives on the storage, so that a specific derivative is
    # generated only once on initial request. If you also set
    # `:upload_redirect`, the endpoint will redirect to the cached derivative
    # on the storage instead of serving it.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true
    #
    # ## Derivation response
    #
    # There are three ways to generate derivation responses. First is the one
    # we've already seen, which is to plug the Rack app into our router.
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       mount ImageUploader.derivation_endpoint => "/derivations/image"
    #     end
    #
    # Second way keeps the URL format, but allows you to route the request to
    # a custom controller. Inside the controller you can call
    # `Shrine.derivation_response` with the Rack env hash to handle the
    # request. The target derivation name and arguments are inferred from
    # the request information. The return value is an array of the status,
    # headers, and body that should be set for the top-level response.
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       get "/derivations/image/*rest" => "derivations#image"
    #     end
    #
    #     # app/controllers/derivations_controller.rb
    #     class DerivationsController < ApplicationController
    #       def image
    #         set_rack_response ImageUploader.derivation_response(request.env)
    #       end
    #
    #       private
    #
    #       def set_rack_response((status, headers, body))
    #         self.status = status
    #         self.headers.merge!(headers)
    #         self.response_body = body
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # This approach gives greater flexibility as it allows executing additional
    # code (e.g. authentication) on the controller level before and after
    # generating a derivation response.
    #
    # The third way allows you to use custom URLs for derivations. In the
    # controller you can call `#derivation_response` directly on the
    # `UploadedFile`, passing the derivation name, arguments, and the Rack env
    # hash.
    #
    #     # config/routes.rb
    #     Rails.application.routes.draw do
    #       resources :photos do
    #         member do
    #           get "thumbnail" # for example
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #     # app/controllers/photos_controller.rb
    #     class PhotosController < ApplicationController
    #       def thubmnail
    #         photo = Photos.find(params[:id])
    #         image = photo.image
    #
    #         set_rack_response image.derivation_response(:thumbnail, 300, 300, env: request.env)
    #       end
    #
    #       private
    #
    #       def set_rack_response((status, headers, body))
    #         self.status = status
    #         self.headers.merge!(headers)
    #         self.response_body = body
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The `Shrine.derivation_endpoint`, `Shrine.derivation_response`, and
    # `UploadedFile#derivation_response` all accept additional options, which
    # override any options set on the plugin level.
    #
    #     ImageUploader.derivation_endpoint(disposition: "attachment")
    #     # or
    #     ImageUploader.derivation_response(env, disposition: "attachment")
    #     # or
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_response(:thumbnail, env: env, disposition: "attachment")
    #
    # ## Dynamic options
    #
    # When passing options to the plugin, to `Shrine.derivation_endpoint`,
    # `Shrine.derivation_response`, or to
    # `Shrine::UploadedFile#derivation_response`, for most options the value
    # can be a block that returns a dynamic result. The block will be evaluated
    # within the context of a `Shrine::Derivation` instance, allowing you to
    # access information about the current derivation:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, disposition: -> {
    #       self   #=> #<Shrine::Derivation>
    #
    #       name   #=> :thumbnail
    #       args   #=> ["500", "400"]
    #       source #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #
    #       # ...
    #     }
    #
    # For example, we can use it to specify thumbnail URLs to be rendered
    # inline in the browser, while other derivatives will be force downloaded.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, disposition: -> {
    #       name == :thumbnail ? "inline" : "attachment"
    #     }
    #
    # ## Host
    #
    # By default generated URLs are relative. To generate absolute URLs, you
    # can pass the `:host` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, host: "https://example.com"
    #
    # Now the generated URLs will include the specified URL host:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> "https://example.com/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # You can also pass `:host` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, host: "https://example.com")
    #     #=> "https://example.com/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # ## Prefix
    #
    # If you're mounting the derivation endpoint under a path prefix, the
    # `:prefix` option needs to match in order for correct URLs to be generated:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, prefix: "derivations/image"
    #
    # Now generated URLs will include the specified path prefix:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> "/derivations/image/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # You can also pass `:prefix` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, prefix: "derivations/image")
    #     #=> "/derivations/image/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?signature=..."
    #
    # ## Expiration
    #
    # By default generated URLs are valid indefinitely. If you want URLs to
    # expire after a certain amount of time, you can set the `:expires_in`
    # option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, expires_in: 90
    #
    # Now any URL will stop being valid 90 seconds after it was generated:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> "/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?expires_at=1547843568&signature=..."
    #
    # You can also pass `:expires_in` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, expires_in: 90)
    #     #=> "/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?expires_at=1547843568&signature=..."
    #
    # ## Response headers
    #
    # ### Content Type
    #
    # By default in the derivation response, the [`Content-Type`] header is
    # inferred from the file extension of the derivative (using `Rack::Mime`).
    # You can override that with the `:type` option:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, type: -> {
    #       "image/webp" if name == :webp
    #     }
    #
    # If the block returns `nil`, then the default type will be set. You can
    # also set `:type` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:webp, type: "image/webp")
    #     #=> "/webp/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?type=image%2Fwebp&signature=..."
    #
    # ### Content Disposition
    #
    # By default in the derivation response, the [`Content-Disposition`] header
    # sets the disposition to `inline`, while the download filename is generated
    # from derivation name, arguments and source file id. You can override that
    # with the `:disposition` and `:filename` options:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint,
    #       disposition: -> { name == :thumbnail ? "inline" : "attachment" },
    #       filename:    -> { [name, *args].join("-") }
    #
    # When the user opens the link in the browser, an `inline` disposition will
    # tell the browser to render the file if possible, while `attachment`
    # disposition will force download.
    #
    # The `:filename` and `:disposition` options can also be set per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:pdf, disposition: "attachment", filename: "custom-filename")
    #     #=> "/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?disposition=attachment&filename=custom-filename&signature=..."
    #
    # ## Uploading
    #
    # By default the derivation from a source file will be called each time
    # it's requested. However, you can cache the derivatives to a storage by
    # setting `:upload` to `true`. On first request the generated derivative
    # will be uploaded to storage, and then on subsequent requests the already
    # uploaded derivative will be served from the storage.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true
    #
    # The derivative will be uploaded to `<source id>/<name>-<args>` by default,
    # and can be changed via `:upload_location`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true, upload_location: -> {
    #       # e.g. "derivatives/9a7d1bfdad24a76f9cfaff137fe1b5c7/thumbnail-1000-800"
    #       ["derivatives", File.basename(source.id, ".*"), [name, *args].join("-")].join("/")
    #     }
    #
    # Since the default upload location won't have any file extension, the
    # derivation response won't know the appropriate `Content-Type` header
    # value, so it will be set to `application/octet-stream`. It's recommended
    # to use the `:type` option to set the appropriate `Content-Type` value.
    #
    # The target storage used is the same as for the source uploaded file, but
    # it can be changed via `:upload_storage`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_storage: :thumbnail_storage
    #
    # Additional storage-specific upload options can be passed via
    # `:upload_options`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_options: { acl: "public-read" }
    #
    # ### Redirecting
    #
    # The derivative content will be served through the endpoint by default.
    # However, you can configure the endpoint to redirect to the uploaded
    # derivative on the storage:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_redirect: true
    #
    # In that case additional storage-specific URL options can also be passed in:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, upload: true,
    #                                  upload_redirect: true,
    #                                  upload_redirect_url_options: { public: true }
    #
    # ## Cache busting
    #
    # The derivation endpoint returns `Cache-Control` header in the derivation
    # response telling HTTP caches like CDNs to cache the response for a year.
    # So if you change how a derivation is being performed, users might still
    # see the previous version of the derivative if it was already generated
    # and cached.
    #
    # If you want the already cached derivatives to be re-generated, you can
    # add a "version" parameter to the URL, which will make HTTP caches treat
    # is as a new URL. You can do this by via the `:version` option. You
    # probably want to bump the version only of the derivations that you've
    # changed.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, version: -> { 1 if name == :thumbnail }
    #
    # Now all `:thumbnail` derivation URLs will include `version` in the query
    # string:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail)
    #     #=> "/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?version=1&signature=..."
    #
    # You can also bump the `:version` per URL:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation_url(:thumbnail, version: 1)
    #     #=> "/thumbnail/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN?version=1&signature=..."
    #
    # ## Accessing uploaded file
    #
    # If you want to access the source `UploadedFile` object when deriving, you
    # can set `:include_uploaded_file` to `true`.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, include_uploaded_file: true
    #
    # Now the source `UploadedFile` will be passed as the second argument of
    # the derivation block:
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |file, uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       uploaded_file             #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #       uploaded_file.id          #=> "9a7d1bfdad24a76f9cfaff137fe1b5c7.jpg"
    #       uploaded_file.storage_key #=> "store"
    #       uploaded_file.metadata    #=> {}
    #
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # By default original metadata that was extracted during attachment isn't
    # available, to keep the derivation URL as short as possible. However, if
    # you want to have original metadata available when deriving, you can set
    # the `:metadata` option to the list of needed metadata values:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, metadata: ["filename", "mime_type"]
    #
    # Now `filename` and `mime_type` metadata values will be available in the
    # derivation block:
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |file, uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       uploaded_file.metadata #=>
    #       # {
    #       #  "filename" => "nature.jpg",
    #       #  "mime_type" => "image/jpeg"
    #       # }
    #
    #       uploaded_file.original_filename #=> "nature.jpg"
    #       uploaded_file.mime_type         #=> "image/jpeg"
    #
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # ## Downloading
    #
    # When a derivation is requested, the original uploaded file will be
    # downloaded to disk before the derivation block is called. If you want
    # to pass in additional storage-specific download options, you can do so
    # via `:download_options`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, download_options: {
    #       sse_customer_algorithm: "AES256",
    #       sse_customer_key:       "secret_key",
    #       sse_customer_key_md5:   "secret_key_md5",
    #     }
    #
    # When using `Shrine.derivation_endpoint` or `Shrine.derivation_response`,
    # if the original uploaded file has been deleted, the error the storage
    # raises when attempting to download it will be propagated by default. You
    # can choose to have the endpoint convert these errors to 404 responses by
    # adding them to `:download_errors`:
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, download_errors: [
    #       Errno::ENOENT,              # raised by Shrine::Storage::FileSystem
    #       Aws::S3::Errors::NoSuchKey, # raised by Shrine::Storage::S3
    #     ]
    #
    # If you don't want the uploaded file to be downloaded to disk for you, set
    # `:download` to `false`.
    #
    #     plugin :derivation_endpoint, download: false
    #
    # In this case the `UploadedFile` object is yielded to the derivation block
    # instead of the raw file:
    #
    #     derivation :thumbnail do |uploaded_file, width, height|
    #       uploaded_file #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # ## Derivation API
    #
    # In addition to generating derivation responses, it's also possible to
    # operate with derivations on a lower level. You can access that API by
    # calling `UploadedFile#derivation`, which returns a `Derivation` object.
    #
    #     derivation = uploaded_file.derivation(:thumbnail, 500, 500)
    #     derivation #=> #<Shrine::Derivation: @name=:thumbnail, @args=[500, 500] ...>
    #     derivation.name   #=> :thumbnail
    #     derivation.args   #=> [500, 500]
    #     derivation.source #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #
    # When initializing the `Derivation` object you can override any plugin
    # options:
    #
    #     uploaded_file.derivation(:grayscale, upload_storage: :other_storage)
    #
    # ### `#url`
    #
    # `Derivation#url` method (called by `UploadedFile#derivation_url`)
    # generates the URL to the derivation.
    #
    #     derivation.url #=> "/thumbnail/500/400/eyJpZCI6ImZvbyIsInN0b3JhZ2UiOiJzdG9yZSJ9?signature=..."
    #
    # ### `#response`
    #
    # `Derivation#response` method (called by
    # `UploadedFile#derivation_response`) generates appropriate status, headers,
    # and body for the derivative to be returned as an HTTP response.
    #
    #     status, headers, body = derivation.response
    #     status  #=> 200
    #     headers #=>
    #     # {
    #     #   "Content-Type" => "image/jpeg",
    #     #   "Content-Length" => "12424",
    #     #   "Content-Disposition" => "inline; filename=\"thumbnail-500-500-k9f8sdksdfk2414\"",
    #     #   "Accept_Ranges" => "bytes"
    #     # }
    #     body    #=> #each object that yields derivative content
    #
    # ### `#processed`
    #
    # `Derivation#processed` method returns the processed derivative. If
    # `:upload` is enabled, it returns an `UploadedFile` object pointing to the
    # derivative, processing and uploading the derivative if it hasn't been
    # already.
    #
    #     uploaded_file = derivation.processed
    #     uploaded_file    #=> #<Shrine::UploadedFile>
    #     uploaded_file.id #=> "bcfd0d67e4a8ec2dc9a6d7ddcf3825a1/thumbnail-500-500"
    #
    # ### `#generate`
    #
    # `Derivation#call` method calls the derivation block and returns the
    # result.
    #
    #     result = derivation.generate
    #     result #=> #<Tempfile:...>
    #
    # Internally it will download the source uploaded file to disk and pass it
    # to the derivation block (unless `:download` was disabled). You can
    # also pass in an already downloaded source file:
    #
    #     derivation.generate(source_file)
    #
    # ### `#upload`
    #
    # `Derivation#upload` method uploads the given file to the configured
    # derivation location.

    # If not given any arguments, it generates the derivative before uploading
    # it.
    #
    # ### `#retrieve`
    #
    # `Derivation#retrieve` method returns the uploaded derivative file. If the
    # file exists on the storage, it returns an `UploadedFile` object,
    # otherwise `nil` is returned.
    #
    #     uploaded_file = derivation.retrieve

    #
    # `Derivation#delete` method deletes the uploaded derivative file from the
    # storage.
    #
    #     derivation.delete
    #
    # ### `#option`
    #
    # `Derivation#option` returns the value of the specified plugin option.
