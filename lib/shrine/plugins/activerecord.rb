    # The `activerecord` plugin extends the "attachment" interface with support
    # for ActiveRecord.
    #
    #     plugin :activerecord
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # Now the attachment module will add additional callbacks to the model:
    #
    # * `before_save` -- Used by the recache plugin.
    # * `after_commit on: [:create, :update]` -- Promotes the attachment, deletes replaced ones.
    # * `after_commit on: [:destroy]` -- Deletes the attachment.
    #
    # Note that ActiveRecord versions 3.x and 4.x have errors automatically
    # silenced in hooks, which can make debugging more difficult, so it's
    # recommended that you enable errors:
    #
    #     # This is the default in ActiveRecord 5
    #     ActiveRecord::Base.raise_in_transactional_callbacks = true
    #
    # Also note that if your tests are wrapped in transactions, the
    # `after_commit` callbacks won't get called, so in order to test uploading
    # you should first disable transactions for those tests.
    #
    # If you want to put promoting/deleting into a background job, see the
    # `backgrounding` plugin.
    #
    # Since attaching first saves the record with a cached attachment, then
    # saves again with a stored attachment, you can detect this in callbacks:
    #
    #     class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #       include ImageUploader[:avatar]
    #
    #       before_save do
    #         if avatar_data_changed? && avatar_attacher.cached?
    #           # cached
    #         end
    #
    #         if avatar_data_changed? && avatar_attacher.stored?
    #           # promoted
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # If you don't want callbacks (e.g. you want to use the attacher object
    # directly), you can turn them off:
    #
    #     plugin :activerecord, callbacks: false
    #
    # ## Validations
    #
    # Additionally, any Shrine validation errors will be added to
    # ActiveRecord's errors upon validation. If you want to validate presence
    # of the attachment, you can do it directly on the model.
    #
    #     class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #       include ImageUploader[:avatar]
    #       validates_presence_of :avatar
    #     end
    #
    # If you're doing validation separately from your models, you can turn off
    # validations for your models:
    #
    #     plugin :activerecord, validations: false
